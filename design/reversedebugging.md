# Reverse Debugging

The main idea is to support not only the (normal) forward stepping but also stepping backwards in time.

Due to emulator restrictions a lightweight approach is chosen.
Fortunately ZEsarUx supports a cpu-transaction-log.
This can record for each executed opcode
- the address
- the opcode
- the registers contents

I.e. while stepping backwards it would be possible to show the correct register contents at that point in time.

The memory contents or other HW states are not recorded.
Therefore this is a lightweight solution.

Anyhow in most cases the reverse debugging feature is used in case we hit a breakpoint and have to step back some opcodes to see why we ended up there.
Of course, knowing the correct memory contents would be beneficially but also without it will be a good help.


# Design

The whole cpu-transaction-log logic is implemented in the ZesaruxEmulator.
I.e. it is hidden from the Emulator class.

The Emulator/ZesaruxEmulator class has to provide methods for step back and running reverse.


When the ZesaruxEmulator class receives a stepBack for the first time it will increment a stepBackCounter.
If this stepBackCounter is not 0 this means the system is in reverse debugging mode.
It now reads the last line of the cpu-transaction-log file and retrieve
- the address
- the registers
- the opcode (as string)

```puml
hide footbox
title User pressed "Step Back"
actor user
participant vscode
participant "Emul\nDebug\nSession" as session
participant "Emulator" as emul
participant "ZEsarUX\nEmulator" as zemul

user -> vscode: "Step Back"
vscode -> session: stepBackRequest

session -> zemul: stepBack

note over zemul: - stepBackCounter++\n- move file pointer to prev line\nin transaction-log

session <-- zemul

vscode <-- session: response
vscode <-- session: StoppedEvent('step')

vscode -> session: ...

vscode -> session: variablesRequest
note over session: ...
session -> emul: getRegisters

emul -> zemul: getRegistersFromEmulator

alt stepBackCounter != 0
note over zemul: - read line of transaction-log\n- read PC and registers and \nreturn values
end

emul <-- zemul
session <-- emul

vscode <-- session: response


```


# Other Requests

- scopesRequest: No special behavior.
- stackTraceRequest: No special behavior. As the memory contents changes are not known this will simply return the current memory state at stepBackCounter=0.
- variablesRequest: No special behavior. The only special variables that change are the registers. These are special treated in the Emulator.

## Pseudocode (ZEsarUX):

### Step back
1. "cpu-step-back" is received: Mode is changed to "reverse-debug-mode". The rl_index is decreased.
3. "get-registers" is received: The register values from the record_list[rl_index] is sent.
3. "get-stack-trace" is received: ??? need to check how this list is generated. If it is a simple memory lookup then I need to save the memory values for sure.

### Continue reverse
1. "run-reverse" is received: Mode is changed to "reverse-debug-mode". The rl_index is decreased in a loop until (this is done very fast)
	a) the list start is reached
	b) a breakpoint condition is met
2. "get-registers" is received: ... same as above

### Step (forward)
1. "cpu-step" is received while in "reverse-debug-made". The rl_index is increased.
~~~
	If rl_index > record_list then: leave "reverse-debug-made".
~~~
2. "get-registers" is received: ... same as above


### Continue (forward)
1. "run" is received while in "reverse-debug-made". The rl_index is increased in a loop until (this is done very fast)
	a) the list end is reached: leave "reverse-debug-made". Run normal "run" (i.e. continue seemingless with normal run mode).
	b) a breakpoint condition is met
2. "get-registers" is received: ... same as above

### Get historic registers
1. "get-historic-register reg" is received: The record list is checked for changes in the register. The current and the past values are sent together with PC values and information when the change happened. E.g.
~~~
-> "get-historic-register DE"
<-
DE=5F8A
DE=34E9 PC=A123 dCount=15
DE=7896 PC=A089 dCount=2343
~~~
Note: dCount (differential count) is a decimal number, i.e. it can grow bigger than FFFFh.

vscode could show this when hovering above a register.
Note: this would require to read always the complete transaction-log.


# Length of the recording

The transaction log can become very big very fast. Each transaction will occupy about 100 bytes. I.e. at a 4MHZ clock speed we will generate about 100MB of data.
Or 1GB per 10 secs. A minute will generate 6GB and an hour generates 360GB.
In modern PCs this is manageable as normally one would require to run a program only for a few secs, maybe minutes.
But in some cases, when e.g. hunting a bug that very rarely occurs and were the system e.g. would have to run over night, it would be more beneficial to have an option to limit the max. length of the transaction log and store only the last transactions.
Like a queue that forgets the oldest entries.

<This is currently discussed with Cesar>.


# Reaching the End of the Recording

When reaching the end of the recording it is not possible to step back further.


# Breakpoints

Running inside the transaction log will, of course, not fire any of the ZEsarUX breakpoints. Neither when running backwards nor forward.

There are several options:
- ignore breakpoints: running would run til the end of the transaction log. This is not helpful. In fact it would be mean that running backward does not work only stepping backward.
- ignore breakpoint conditions (other than the PC): This would be simple to implement and would already cover a lot of use case.
- mimic the breakpoint conditions: the breakpoint conditions could be evaluated during running inside the transaction-log. This would be one of the best options although the most difficult to implement. It is also questionable how many use cases this will really include as the memory conditions can anyway not be tested. So we can only check on register values.




# Additional Features

Ideas:

- E.g. history of registers:
It would be possible to have a look at the registers, e.g. when they changed. With a click one could move to the source code location/time when the change happened.
